# LCtesterror

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of LCtesterror is to estimate true prevalence from test data accounting for unknown test error.

## Installation

You can install the development version of LCtesterror from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bristol-vaccine-centre/LCtesterror")
```
<!-- Need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. 
If adding plots need to commit and push resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

## Example

Example:

```{r example}
library(LCtesterror)
